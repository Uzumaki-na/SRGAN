A high-performance implementation of SRGAN (Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network) using TensorFlow 2.0+. This project achieves state-of-the-art performance in single image super-resolution, capable of upscaling images by 4x while maintaining photo-realistic quality.

## 🌟 Key Features

- **4x Upscaling**: Transform low-resolution images to high-resolution with 4x scale factor
- **Photo-Realistic Output**: Advanced perceptual loss for superior visual quality
- **Efficient Architecture**: Optimized implementation using residual blocks and skip connections
- **Custom Training Pipeline**: Fully customizable training process with monitoring capabilities
- **Pre-trained Models**: Ready-to-use pre-trained models for instant deployment
- **Comprehensive Evaluation**: Built-in metrics for PSNR and perceptual quality assessment

## 🚀 Technical Implementation

### Architecture Overview

- **Generator**: 
  - SRResNet architecture with 24 residual blocks
  - PReLU activation functions
  - PixelShuffle upsampling
  - Global skip connection
  
- **Discriminator**:
  - VGG-style architecture
  - Leaky ReLU activations
  - Dense classification layer
  - Batch normalization for training stability

### Loss Functions

- **Perceptual Loss**: VGG19-based feature matching
- **Adversarial Loss**: Binary cross-entropy
- **Content Loss**: Pixel-wise MSE + VGG feature reconstruction
- **Total Variation Loss**: For spatial smoothness

## 📊 Performance Metrics

- **PSNR**: ~28-30 dB on benchmark datasets
- **SSIM**: ~0.85-0.90 on test sets
- **Training Time**: ~24 hours on NVIDIA V100
- **Inference Speed**: ~0.5s per 256x256 image on GPU
